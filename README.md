> One of my all-time favorite films is **Whiplash**, and I believe that everyone can identify with the notion of pursuing Being so-called *Perfect* is something that humans are hooked to, whether it is *perfection* or *greatness* in our craft. This film, however, illustrates—or rather provides an example of—what it's like to strive for *Perfection* in our art. It involves setting priorities and is a terrible and drawn-out process of training till one of your body parts falls off. Pursuing your *perfection* rather than yourself, forcing you to push yourself to the limit and cut connections.

As Fletcher says: “*There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job*" 
good job means that's good enough, good job means that's okay. It means that people shouldn't settle for *okay*
as he is a firm believer in pursuing perfection. 

However, there is no such thing as **Perfect** in the end; humans are only so near to that level.
yet, we will never be able to achieve it. Because mistakes and failures are common, I believe
we shouldn't be content with just being **okay** instead we should be pushing ourselves
to our absolute limits, because the sky is the limit.
